"""Exercise 4.2 — Working with a dictionary

WHAT THE PROGRAM MUST DO
    Describe one real object from your field using a dictionary of at least five fields,
    then read it, change it, remove one field, and display every field with its value.

ANSWER THESE FIRST, in comments at the top of your file
    1. What goes in?
    2. What happens to it?
    3. What comes out?
    4. What object did you describe, which five fields did you choose, and why those?
       A field you would never actually use does not count.

WHAT THE AI CANNOT KNOW
    Your object and your fields. A campaign, a customer, a product, a store, a supplier.
    Choose something you would genuinely have to describe in your job.

CHECK IT YOURSELF
    Ask your program for a field that does not exist. Note what happens in a comment,
    then make it survive that case.

DELIVERABLE
    This file, with your comments and your code.

# 1. In: A dictionary describing a marketing campaign.
# 2. Process: I read the fields, update one value, remove one field, and print every value.
# 3. Out: The full dictionary before and after changes, plus a safe answer for a missing field.
# 4. My object is a digital campaign. My five fields are name, channel, budget, goal, and status
#    because these are the real pieces of information a marketer needs to monitor.


# Your code below
campaign = {
    "name": "Spring Launch",
    "channel": "Google Ads",
    "budget": 2000,
    "goal": "brand awareness",
    "status": "active"
}

print("Original campaign:")
for key, value in campaign.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

campaign["budget"] = 2500
campaign["audience"] = "students"
campaign.pop("status")

print("\nUpdated campaign:")
for key, value in campaign.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

print("\nMissing field:", campaign.get("country", "This field does not exist."))
