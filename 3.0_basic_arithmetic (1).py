"""Exercise 3.0 — Computing with what the user typed

WHAT THE PROGRAM MUST DO
    Ask for two numbers and display the result of the four operations.

ANSWER THESE FIRST, in comments at the top of your file
    1. What goes in?
    2. What happens to it?
    3. What comes out?
    4. What should your program do when the second number is zero? Decide, write your
       decision down, and only then implement it.

WHAT THE AI CANNOT KNOW
    Your answer to question 4. There are at least three defensible ones: refuse the
    value and ask again, display a message instead of a result, or stop the program.
    Pick one and be able to defend it.

CHECK IT YOURSELF
    Compute 7 divided by 2 in your head. Run your program with 7 and 2. If your program
    shows 3, it is not wrong by accident: find out why, and write the reason in a comment.
    Then run it with 0 as the second number.

DELIVERABLE
    This file, with your comments and your code.

# 1. In: Two numbers entered by the user.
# 2. Process: They are added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided.
# 3. Out: The sum, difference, product, and quotient.
# 4. If the second number is zero, the program will show a message instead of dividing.
#    Division by zero is undefined.
#    Python's / operator does true division, so 7 / 2 is 3.5, not 3.


# Your code below
number1 = float(input("Enter number 1: "))
number2 = float(input("Enter number 2: "))

# sum of two numbers
sum_result = number1 + number2
print("The sum of the two numbers is:", sum_result)

# difference of two numbers
difference = number1 - number2
print("The difference of the two numbers is:", difference)

# multiply two numbers
product = number1 * number2
print("The product of the two numbers is:", product)

# division of two numbers
if number2 == 0:
    print("The second number cannot be zero. Division by zero is undefined.")
else:
    division = number1 / number2
    print("The division of the two numbers is:", division)
